# c-_calculator
A scientific calculator written in c++, this is mainly to program on my bus ride home which is beginning to become very frustrating. I have written this in c++ on a ubuntu 16.04 laptop. The overall scope of this project is to get myself reacquainted with data structures classes structs and pointers.
